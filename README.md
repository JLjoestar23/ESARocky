# Engineering Systems Analysis: The Rocky Project

![pendulum-free-body-diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e81b17aa-ff72-4445-be82-d10f1ec289d3)

The Rocky project is a classic problem from control theory: balancing an inverted pendulum on a horizontally-translating cart along a single axis. The inverted pendulum is one of the most commonly used representations of an unstable system, making it a great example for an introduction to control theory. The hardware used is a modified Balboa Balancing Robot Kit from Pololu Robotics and Electronics. The main goal was to implement PI control to keep the robot balancing upright and in place, rejecting disturbances within the capability of the hardware.

This repository consists of all relevant files used in the project.
